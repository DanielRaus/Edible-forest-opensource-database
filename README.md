# Edible-forest-opensource-database

In collaboration with ValonRexhepi and DepBastos, 2th year I.T. students of HES-SO Sierre / Switzerland, during the Agricathon 2021.

The first aim of this project is to provide a data start to help farmers and anyone wishing to create an edible and responsible forest. However, this database can be completed and can be used for any other purpose.

This open source project will remain free, open and public to everyone. Anyone who wants to use and contribute to this project is welcome as no such database exists to date.

!!!
**Please, if you are contributing to the project, please add the references of your data so that you can verify their veracity.**
